# Digital Sleep Sounds

## What is this?

This repository is for a project website, [digitalsleepsounds.com](https://digitalsleepsounds.com). 

## How's it made?

Pure HTML and CCS. That's it. Icons are provided by [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) and fonts themselves by [Google Fonts](http://fonts.google.com).

I use [Nova](https://nova.app) to commit changes to this repository.

With every new commit, a new build of my website is automatically deployed via [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com). Cloudflare hosts my domain and also handles DNS so everything's under one roof; I like that.
